## Requirements:
* Install Docker on each of the virtual machines by these commands: </br>
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y </br>
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ -o get-docker.sh </br>
bash get-docker.sh </br>
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y </br>
* Node.js 12.x or higher
* Configure an agent: [agent-pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psa8xfJ0-zI&ab_channel=Raaviblog) 
* PostgreSQL (can be installed locally using Docker)
* Free Okta developer account for account registration, login


## Steps:
* Create 2 resource groups for 2 environments- staging and production which contains: 2 AKS - Kubernetes Cluster in Microsoftâ€™s Azure Kubernetes Service for the project infrastructure..
* Create a virtual machine and install on it docker and agent by azure devops.
* Create a container registy 
* Install the Nginx ingress controller by with the commands: 
choco install kubernetes-helm
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install my-release bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller
* Deploy the NodeWeightTracker application on AKS meeting the following requirements:
- The NodeWeightTracker application must be accessible from the internet
- The NodeWeightTracker application must be exposed to the internet on port 80
- The NodeWeightTracker must have at least 3 instances to ensure high availability
- Use configmaps/secrets to store your application configurations
- You must expose your application using the ingress controller
* Run the pipeline and check that your applications are running :)

# Emphasis:
* To install all dependencies on the nodes and to deploy and run the application for the first time I've used this project - https://github.com/inbalLevi/bootcamp-app
